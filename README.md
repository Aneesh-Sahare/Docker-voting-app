The voting application is composed of several distinct components:
/n
Voting App: A Python-based web application built with Flask, where users cast their votes.
/n
Redis: A messaging system that collects the submitted votes.
/n
Worker: A .NET application (with a Java-like code sample preserved) that processes votes and updates a PostgreSQL database.
/n
Result App: A Node.js and Express application that retrieves and displays voting results from the database.
